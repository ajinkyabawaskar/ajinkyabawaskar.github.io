This post is about interview experience for a position of Web Application Developer at [Media.net](https://media.net). I applied for the role from [Instahyre](https://instahyre.com). I got an email from their recruiter regarding interview. I gave one interview round based on logic, algorithms & data structures. The round lasted for around 1.5 hours since I took more time to come up with logic. I was asked these questions (in mentioned order)
- [Count ways to reach nth stair](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-ways-reach-nth-stair/)
- [Minimum number of coins that make a change](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-number-of-coins-that-make-a-change/)
- HTML parser without using inbuilt string functions that replaces special characters - Replace `&amp;` with `&`, `&gt;` with `>` & so on.
    
    For example, input string: "I am good `&amp;` bad"

    Output string: "I am good & bad"

Overall, I was able to solve first and third questions completely & second question partially. I am yet to receive the verdict yet, however it was a good interview.

Update - The verdict came in on 23rd, only the next working day after I gave my interview & I **didn't** make it. I didn't receive any feedback from the interviewer/recruiter but the most likely reason for this outcome seems to be that I took longer to solve the questions than expected.
