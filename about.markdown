Hello and welcome to the Internet home of Ajinkya Bawaskar! 

I am a software enthusiast, currently working at [GlobalLogic](https://www.globallogic.com/in/) as Associate Software Engineer in Innovation and R&D projects. I also work with a non-profit organization [Dweebs Global](https://dweebsglobal.org/), building software that manages their workflow. I also volunteer with [Foss United](https://fossunited.org/), another non-profit where I do my bit to promote free and open source software.

The extent to which technology has influced our day-to-day life amazes me. I feel that software, in particular has changed the course of human history, in many many incredible ways. I aspire to write software that solves real-world problems and impact the society as whole.

I have just begun on this journey to explore software development and everything that is associated with it. I might not know much but I want to share as I continue to move forward.
I am writing this blog both, as a record of what my thoughts are at a point of time and also to help anyone who might be on the same journey as me!

And that's where the name of this blog comes from:
<b>Variable</b> - something that keeps changing what it contains in order for the program to continue on this path towards successful result.
